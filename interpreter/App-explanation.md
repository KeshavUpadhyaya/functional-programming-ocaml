# Explanation for function application

```ocaml
let addOne = Fun ("x", Op ("+", Id "x", N 1))
let result = App (addOne, N 5)
```

In this example, we define a function `addOne` that takes a single argument `x` and returns the result of adding `x` and `1`. The body of the function is `Op ("+", Id "x", N 1)`, representing the addition operation between the variable `x` and the integer `1`.

We then apply the function `addOne` to the argument `N 5`, which represents the integer value `5`. This is done using the `App` constructor: `App (addOne, N 5)`.

Now, let's go through the evaluation steps according to the code snippet you provided:

1. `App (addOne, N 5)` matches the pattern `App (e1, e2)`, where `e1` is `addOne` and `e2` is `N 5`.

2. The line `let (Fval (y, e', env')) = eval e1 env in` evaluates the function expression `addOne` in the current environment `env`. Since `addOne` is a function, it matches the pattern `Fval (y, e', env')`, where `y` will be bound to `"x"`, `e'` will be bound to `Op ("+", Id "x", N 1)`, and `env'` will be bound to the environment where `addOne` was defined.

3. After matching the `Fval` value, the line `eval e' ((y, eval e2 env) :: env')` performs the function application. Let's substitute the variables with their corresponding values:
   - `e'` is `Op ("+", Id "x", N 1)` (the body expression of the function).
   - `y` is `"x"` (the parameter name of the function).
   - `e2` is `N 5` (the argument expression).
   - `env` is the current environment.
   - `env'` is the environment where `addOne` was defined.

4. The expression becomes `eval (Op ("+", Id "x", N 1)) ((y, eval (N 5) env) :: env')`. Evaluating `eval (N 5) env` results in `Ival 5`, as `N 5` simply represents the integer value `5`.

5. Substituting the values again, the expression becomes `eval (Op ("+", Id "x", N 1)) (("x", Ival 5) :: env')`. Here, `("x", Ival 5)` is a binding representing the argument value `5` for the parameter `x`.

6. Evaluating the body expression with the extended environment, `eval (Op ("+", Id "x", N 1)) (("x", Ival 5) :: env')`, substitutes `Id "x"` with `Ival 5`, resulting in `Op ("+", Ival 5, N 1)`.

7. Finally, evaluating `Op ("+", Ival 5, N 1)` performs the addition operation, resulting in `Ival 6`.

So, the overall result of evaluating `App (addOne, N 5)` is `Ival 6`, which represents the integer value `6`. The function `addOne` was successfully applied to the argument `5`, resulting in the expected result.
